# Python-Project-1

Project: - Capstone Project (Netflix).

I am done this project at Intellipaat Solution Pvt. Ltd. as an Trainee.

In this project, I identified the list of the most popular and liked genres. I created a model that finds the best-suited movie for each user in every genre. Additionally, I determined which genre movies have received the best and worst ratings based on user ratings.
